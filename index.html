<h1>What is ShadeBot?</h1>
ShadeBot is a discord bot primarily made for the Hentai! server Discord. Its function is to welcome people using a specific room. When users join the server, they can only see important channels like announcements and this welcoming room. They need to have a profile picture & type a specific password and they will then be given a role which will allow them access to the normal channels. They will then be welcomed either by Private message or via a room. ShadeBot also has an optional logging version of the welcome, which can go into a staff log.

<h1>Installation</h1>

<h3>- Install Required Programs -</h3>

Before you can download and setup the bot, there are 2 programs you need to have installed on your computer to make sure everything runs on first go:

Git: https://git-scm.com/downloads
Node JS: https://nodejs.org/en/download/current/

<h3>- Download Project Files -</h3>

After you have the required programs installed, you can go ahead and download the project files. To do that, you either download the ZIP folder or do <code>git clone https://github.com/ShadeBot/ShadeBot-Discord-Bot.git</code> if you are a console person. Once you finish downloading it you will be ready to setup the config files.

<h3>- Setup Config Files -</h3>

Once you download the project files you will see the <code>configbot.json</code> you'll need to fill it with how you would like ShadeBot to work.
As well as the config file, there's the jsonStorage which will contain a few files which can be edited of its content. However, all of them can be edited from within Discord.

<h4>&lt; Windows &gt;</h4>

Open the <code>installer.bat</code> file. This will install the required node modules (so you don’t have to do it yourself) and create a <code>run.bat</code> file. You can use this file to start the bot. If you did everything correctly, the bot should start up fine.

If for some reason you have ran <code>installer.bat</code>, it disappeared and it didn’t create <code>run.bat</code>, then re-download <code>installer.bat</code> and try again. Most likely either git or node were not installed correctly. Check if they work and try again.


<h4>&lt; Linux / Mac &gt;</h4>

Executable files are kind of weird in Linux, and users most likely use console to do their work. So, to setup this bot on Linux or mac open a terminal in the directory you downloaded the files to and either type <code>./installer.sh</code> or if the script doesn't work manually type <code>npm i</code>.

Once it is finished you can start the bot by using the <code>run.sh</code> script that will keep restarting the bot if it crashes (if the installer worked correctly) otherwise try <code>npm start</code> or <code>node self.js</code>. If you did everything correctly, the bot should start up fine.

<b>Currently ShadeBot is made more for the <a href="https://discord.gg/0rJcIjZ54vYONbfJ">Hentai server</a>. However has a config file to be able to change how it works!</b>
